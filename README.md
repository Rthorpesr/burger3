 - Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.


 - burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

 - The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
